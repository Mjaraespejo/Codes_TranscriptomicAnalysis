# Codes_TranscriptomicAnalysis
This repository contains thefiles and scripts used for the analysis of embryogenesis time-course RNA-seq data, including tasks from expression quantification to summarisation and generatio of results figures.

In **3_1_Transcriptomic data analysis.nb.html** are the files and scripts to:
- Run gene expression quantification quantification at the gene, exon and intron level
- Run PCA analysis
- Run TPM normalisation across expression count matrix
- Test for epxression correlations between stages and library types
- Summariise stage-specific epxression
- To interpretate and generate figures showing main results
